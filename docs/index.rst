.. Coil CMS documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Coil CMS is retired
===================

The Coil project is retired due to low interest and lack of resources. Instead, we recommend using `Dato CMS or Netlify CMS <https://getnikola.com/blog/a-cms-or-two-for-nikola-dato-cms-and-netlify-cms-integration.html>`_.

We cannot guarantee full compatibility with modern versions of Nikola, or that anything still works with Coil.
